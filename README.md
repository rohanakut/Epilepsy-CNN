# Epilepsy-CNN

This project involves detecting epileptic signals using the open source dataset provided by Bonn University [1]. 

# Time Series Analysis

To test the effectiveness of deep learning models in epilepsy detection we used two types of processings namely: Wavelet transform and Welch ransform and tested the effectiveness of pre-processings on deep learning models. To test the effectiveness we trained CNN and RNN and compared the accuracy of two trained models. 

# Converting time series data to images
To determine if deep learning models can effectively summarise spectograms, we converted epilepsy data into spectrograms and passed them to Squeezenet, Distributed architecture and LeNet. However, the accuracy of epilepsy detection was lower than the time series method.
