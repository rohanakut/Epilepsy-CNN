# Epilepsy-CNN

This project involves detecting epileptic signals using the open source dataset provided by Bonn University [1]. 

To test the effectiveness of deep learning models in epilepsy detection we used CNN, RNN, spectograms as well as distributed training.
Each approach is highlighted in colab notebook detailing the accuracy of every approach.
